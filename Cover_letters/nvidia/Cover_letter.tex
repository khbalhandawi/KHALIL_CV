Dear Ms. Malloni,

\medskip % Extra whitespace before the next section 
I am very excited to learn of the opportunity to be a part of NVIDIA's growing research team as a research scientist. While I may not be your typical computer science candidate because of my mechanical engineering background, I believe I can add a lot of value to the research done at NVIDIA because of my multidisciplinary skillset. I view this as a strength because I am able to communicate ideas and concepts openly across multiple teams and help bring researchers from several backgrounds together. 

I felt even more encouraged to apply after learning about how much NVIDIA values diversity and openness. The prospect of collaborating and working with others from different backgrounds and cultures in a multidisciplinary team always excites me and has always been a defining characteristic of my academic career.

\medskip % Extra whitespace before the next section

I believe that my strong mathematical and simulation skills, combined with my love for mentoring and guiding others will add a lot of value to the research done at NVIDIA. Nothing gives me a greater sense of joy than hearing about the accomplishments of my students. I was so excited to learn about the wide array of applications for AI and GPU computing when I watched several of NVIDIA's research showcases. The applications vary all the way from space exploration to micro-biology and medical imaging. The multidisciplinary nature of the work done at NVIDIA is so inspirational and aligns well with my career goals.

\medskip % Extra whitespace before the next section

Although I am happy with my current job working as a researcher at McGill and coming up with my own research ideas, guiding and supervising students to make their ideas a reality, I wanted to explore something different that I could only find at NVIDIA. That is the opportunity to work on something cool and fun that can benefit all of human-kind such as video games, immersive virtual worlds, and even space exploration; not just topics related to engineering. 

\medskip % Extra whitespace before the next section

I hope you enjoy going through my profile and my projects on GitHub (linked in my CV) and I hope we can discuss all of this. Needless to say, I am a huge fan of the technologies and products enabled by NVIDIA's GPUs! I feel that this passion will push me far beyond my abilities. Ever since I was a kid, working with computer technology leaders is all I ever wanted to do and seeing this opportunity, I think it could actually happen!

% I realize that being a research scientist entails three things: 1) Mentorship and supervision acumen 2) Strong research skills 3) Good communication skills to present key takeaways from cutting-edge research.

% I have ample experience with all three fields and thrive on mentoring and teaching my students. Nothing gives me a greater sense of joy than hearing about the accomplishments of my students. As you can tell from my career profile, I made it a habit to always engage in research and mentorship simultaneously and never turned away anyone that asks for my opinion or guidance.

% I have a strong mathematical background in research related to numerical optimization, simulation and data-driven models. I combined these three aspects to automate time-consuming simulation-based design problems in the aerospace industry and was able to transform my ideas into industrial practice through the training programs and workshops that I conducted for our industrial partners (GKN Aerospace). Due to my multidisciplinary skillset I even ventured into epidemiology when the COVID-19 pandemic struck and developed detailed agent-based models (accelerated by CUDA) for forecasting the trajectory of the epidemic. I came up intervention policies that help governments make decisions when little is known about the pandemic.

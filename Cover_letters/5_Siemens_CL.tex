Dear HEEDS team manager,

\medskip % Extra whitespace before the next section 
I would like to express my enthusiasm and excitement for the opportunity to be a part of Siemens digital industries and work with leading industry experts on developing cutting-edge simulation and computational solutions. I have learned about this position through my colleague, Dr. Ahmed Bayoumy from the HEEDS team.

\medskip % Extra whitespace before the next section

I believe that my experience during my doctoral studies is well-aligned with the work being done at HEEDS and the role that I would be filling. My PhD dissertation focused on surrogate modeling and surrogate-based optimization to help explore large design spaces with relatively low computational effort. I also used advanced data visualization tools such as parallel coordinates and 2D projections of high-dimensional hypersurfaces to communicate results. This work resulted in a set-based design toolbox for my industrial collaborators at GKN Aerospace, Sweden. 

\medskip % Extra whitespace before the next section

I also worked on public health projects during my doctoral studies and developed an epidemiological simulation application for predicting the trajectory of the pandemic. The simulation was interactive and employed a Qt user interface for displaying results and allowing the user to asses the impact of different public health policies in realtime. The computations were accelerated using the CUDA C++ API.

\medskip % Extra whitespace before the next section

I am also very excited for the opportunity to work with a diverse range of products and projects within HEEDS and collaborate with a multidisciplinary team. My lab specializes in multidisciplinary design optimization for coordinating the engineering activities of multidisciplinary teams and organizations. I am also very interested in providing training workshops and modules for the features that I develop at HEEDS as part of such interdisciplinary collaborations.

\medskip % Extra whitespace before the next section

Although I am happy with my current job working as a researcher at McGill and coming up with my own research ideas, guiding and supervising students to make their ideas a reality, I wanted to explore something different that I could only find at Siemens. That is the opportunity to work with a multidisciplinary team and bring people's ideas together.

\medskip % Extra whitespace before the next section

I believe that my strong mathematical and simulation skills, experience in software development, and understanding of the industry's simulation needs will add a lot of value to the development efforts of the HEEDS team. I hope you enjoy going through my profile and my projects on my website (\href{https://khbalhandawi.github.io/projects/}{https://khbalhandawi.github.io/projects/}) and I hope we can discuss all of this. Needless to say, I am a huge fan of the technologies and products of Siemens digital industries on which I based my doctoral studies. I feel that this passion will push me far beyond my abilities.

% I realize that being a research scientist entails three things: 1) Mentorship and supervision acumen 2) Strong research skills 3) Good communication skills to present key takeaways from cutting-edge research.

% I have ample experience with all three fields and thrive on mentoring and teaching my students. Nothing gives me a greater sense of joy than hearing about the accomplishments of my students. As you can tell from my career profile, I made it a habit to always engage in research and mentorship simultaneously and never turned away anyone that asks for my opinion or guidance.

% I have a strong mathematical background in research related to numerical optimization, simulation and data-driven models. I combined these three aspects to automate time-consuming simulation-based design problems in the aerospace industry and was able to transform my ideas into industrial practice through the training programs and workshops that I conducted for our industrial partners (GKN Aerospace). Due to my multidisciplinary skillset I even ventured into epidemiology when the COVID-19 pandemic struck and developed detailed agent-based models (accelerated by CUDA) for forecasting the trajectory of the epidemic. I came up intervention policies that help governments make decisions when little is known about the pandemic.

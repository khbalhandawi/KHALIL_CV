Dear Hiring Manager,

\medskip % Extra whitespace before the next section 

I am writing to express my interest in the Optimization Specialist role within the Transformation of Industry organization at Seimens Energy. I am excited about the opportunity to leverage my optimization, simulation, and modeling experience for helping in decarbonizing industry and contribute to Seimens Energy's operations.

\medskip % Extra whitespace before the next section 

I understand that as part of the role, I will be solving business problems pertinent to turbomachinery using various optimization techniques. I have relevant experience in the field of optimization as an instructor at McGill and as a researcher at McGill and Universit\'{e} de Montr\'{e}al. I have 6 years of experience doing research on aerospace, aeroengine, and aviation related projects at said institutions.

\medskip % Extra whitespace before the next section 

During my doctoral and postdoctoral research, I worked on aerospace design related projects, where I had to solve design optimization problems in relation to aeroengines. I believe this experience is extremely relevant for this position as I had to use nonlinear programming and derivative-free optimization to solve various design problems involving turbomachinery. I used API scripting in various commercial software to generate and analyze parametric CAD models (generated using NX Seimens and analyzed using Abaqus CAE using structural and thermal simulation) which gave me the necessary exposure to simulation tools that are commonly used in the industry. I also solved robust design optimization problems where some of the design requirements are modeled by probabilistic functions. I authored a \href{https://sed-group.github.io/mvmlib/index.html}{Python library} and a \href{https://github.com/khbalhandawi/scale_AM_webapp}{web application} to support the design activities of our industry partner, GKN Aerospace engine systems.

\medskip % Extra whitespace before the next section 

I was also an adjunct lecturer at McGill University, teaching the engineering systems optimization course (MECH559) to engineering students. I covered various topics in optimization starting with basic theoretical foundations (FONCs and SOSCs), leading up to linear programming, nonlinear programming, sequential quadratic programming, multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) (a kind of distributed optimization), and derivative-free optimization. As part of this course, I authored several \href{https://github.com/khbalhandawi/MECH559_notebooks}{notebooks in Python and Julia} to help the students understand the implementation of said algorithms and solve real-world engineering problems in their projects.

\medskip % Extra whitespace before the next section 

I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at the department of computer science and operations research (DIRO) at the Universit\'{e} de Montr\'{e}al as part of an industrial project with the international air transport association (IATA). My current research focuses on graph representation learning from aviation data collected over the last decade to assess the effectiveness and impact of the IATA operation safety audit (IOSA) on air travel accessibility and cooperation between airlines. 

\medskip % Extra whitespace before the next section 

I also worked on healthcare related projects, where I had to develop machine learning models for forecasting the trajectory of the pandemic. As part of these projects I used deep learning (with PyTorch) to build recurrent neural networks for the purpose of providing short term predictions.

\medskip % Extra whitespace before the next section 

I believe these experiences are relevant to the role in the following ways: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item I can create parametric CAD and simulation models of various turbomachinery components given my past doctroal and postdoctoral experience working with GKN Aerospace.
	\item I can apply machine learning and statistical modeling given my experience in surrogate modeling, graph representation learning, and deep learning.
	\item I can develop and validate models (both simulation-based, and statistical) given my previous modeling and simulation experience during aerospace design, healthcare, and aviation related projects.
	\item I can apply mathematical optimization techniques given my optimization background and experience in research and teaching.
	\item I can monitor and support university students at Siemens Energy given my past experience teaching and supervising engineering students at McGill University and Universit\'{e} de Montr\'{e}al.
\end{itemize}

Thank you for considering my application. I would be honored to have the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further and show you my \href{https://khbalhandawi.github.io/projects/}{portfolio} of projects. Please feel free to contact me through any of the channels at the top of this letter.

Dear hiring manager,

\medskip % Extra whitespace before the next section 
I would like to be upfront about my nationality when applying for the research engineer position at GE corporate. Unfortunately, I am a Syrian national which I understand is on the list of embargoed countries. Nonetheless, I felt compelled to apply for this position because I am highly educated and experienced and I have a strong passion for research. The job description is very well-aligned with my PhD dissertation about uncertainty modeling in engineering design. I have worked a lot with DOE/DACE, metamodeling, and machine learning during my PhD and postdoctoral research. I also would like to point out that I am a Canadian Permanent Resident and should become a citizen next year. 

\medskip % Extra whitespace before the next section

I believe that my strong mathematical and simulation skills, combined with my love for mentoring and guiding others will add a lot of value to the research done at GE. Nothing gives me a greater sense of joy than hearing about the accomplishments of my students. I was so excited to learn about the opportunity to work in a multidisciplinary team at GE and learn from a lot of individuals with different backgrounds.

\medskip % Extra whitespace before the next section

Although I am happy with my current job working as a researcher at McGill and coming up with my own research ideas, guiding and supervising students to make their ideas a reality, I wanted to explore something different that I could only find at GE. That is the opportunity to work with a multidisciplinary team and bring people's ideas together. My lab specializes in multidisciplinary design optimization which is developed for coordinating the engineering activities of multidisciplinary teams and organizations.

I hope you enjoy going through my profile and my projects on my website (\href{https://khbalhandawi.github.io/projects/}{https://khbalhandawi.github.io/projects/}) and I hope we can discuss all of this. Needless to say, I am a huge fan of the technologies and products at GE. I feel that this passion will push me far beyond my abilities.

% I realize that being a research scientist entails three things: 1) Mentorship and supervision acumen 2) Strong research skills 3) Good communication skills to present key takeaways from cutting-edge research.

% I have ample experience with all three fields and thrive on mentoring and teaching my students. Nothing gives me a greater sense of joy than hearing about the accomplishments of my students. As you can tell from my career profile, I made it a habit to always engage in research and mentorship simultaneously and never turned away anyone that asks for my opinion or guidance.

% I have a strong mathematical background in research related to numerical optimization, simulation and data-driven models. I combined these three aspects to automate time-consuming simulation-based design problems in the aerospace industry and was able to transform my ideas into industrial practice through the training programs and workshops that I conducted for our industrial partners (GKN Aerospace). Due to my multidisciplinary skillset I even ventured into epidemiology when the COVID-19 pandemic struck and developed detailed agent-based models (accelerated by CUDA) for forecasting the trajectory of the epidemic. I came up intervention policies that help governments make decisions when little is known about the pandemic.
